### Molecular-Structure-Isomorphism

- In Molecular structure, the structure of chemical bond is very different than normal graph hence it becomes very tedious job to apply graph isomorphism algorithms for such kinds of structure. 

- In this structure, nodes represents atoms and edges represents covalent bonds. Structural formula shows chemical information and this formula should be uniquely indexed and identified . Molecule structures are studied by graph theory.


## Proposed Isomorphism Algorithm

- The proposed algorithm for isomorphism is VF2 algorithm.
- The Graph Matcher are responsible for matching graphs in a predetermined manner. This usually means a check for an isomorphism, though other checks are also possible.
